I'm Yusen Su (苏雨森), a PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) at the [University of Waterloo](http://www.uwaterloo.ca/), advised by Prof. [Arie Gurfinkel](https://arieg.bitbucket.io/).

<!-- I hold an MSc in Computer Science from NYU (advised by Prof. Thomas Wies), a BSc from the University of Minnesota, and a dual BSc from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. -->


<!-- My research focuses on designing, implementing, and using **static program analysis** techniques to automatically verify software and optimize existing toolchains. Currently, I am working on building scalable analysis while remaining practical precision for verification tasks. I designed abstract domains in the [Crab](https://github.com/seahorn/crab) which provides plenty of abstract domains for static analyses based on abstract interpretation. I also contributed to [SeaHorn](https://seahorn.github.io/) (adding practical supports for [SeaBMC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10026593) etc.). Before my PhD, I implemented [Drift](https://github.com/nyu-acsys/drift), a refinement type system and abstract interpretation based verifier for numerical properties check. You can find all my research projects on this page. -->
